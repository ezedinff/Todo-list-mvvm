application for demonstration MVvm architectural model
 a software architectural pattern.

MVVM facilitates a separation of development of the graphical user interface – be it via a markup language or GUI code –
from development of the business logic or back-end logic (the data model). The view model of MVVM is a value converter,[1] 
meaning the view model is responsible for exposing (converting) the data objects from the model in such a way that objects 
are easily managed and presented. In this respect, the view model is more model than view, and handles most if not all 
of the view's display logic.[1] The view modelmay implement a mediator pattern, organizing access to the back-end
logic around the set of use cases supported by the view.

the user of this application can add tasks and as well as remove tasks from the list.
